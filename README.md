# Doctor Appointment System

## Project Overview

The Doctor Appointment System is a web application designed to allow patients to easily schedule medical consultations and manage their medical history. This system facilitates efficient management of appointments, patient data, and interactions between healthcare providers and patients. It leverages Spring Boot for backend development, Thymeleaf for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database for storing patient and appointment data.

This system aims to improve the overall healthcare experience by simplifying appointment bookings, tracking medical records, and streamlining communication between patients and healthcare providers.
